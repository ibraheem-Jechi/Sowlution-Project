🧠 Sowlution Frontend Test — Search & Highlight App (React)

A clean and simple React application built for the Sowlution Frontend Developer Assessment.
This project allows users to search text, highlight matches, and navigate through occurrences (e.g. “1 of 20”) in real-time.



🧩 Features

✅ Real-time Search — Highlights as you type
✅ Smart Highlighting — All matches, with one active
✅ Match Counter — Displays “1 of N” with Next/Prev
✅ Responsive Layout — Clean and mobile-friendly
✅ Pure React Implementation — No backend required

🧠 How It Works

The user types a keyword in the search bar.

The app finds all matches across the text.

All matches are highlighted — the current match is shown in orange.

“Prev / Next” buttons let users cycle through matches.
